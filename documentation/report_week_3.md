# Report Week 3
- Configuration refactor. (0.25h)
- Wrote one more triangulation test. Wrote Disjoint Set, Minimum spanning tree
and corridor picking tests. (2h)
- Wrote A* and grid tests. (2.5h)
- Wrote Immediate GUI for the application. (2h)
- Added background thread for generating grids for the application in order to
prevent the main drawing thread from blocking on large inputs. (2h)
- Changed rendering to use a render texture. (1.5h)
- Wrote initial version of the testing documentation. (1h)

Note: I am a bit uncertain whether my tests are good enough, however, I am sure
that during the feedback after week 4 I will have more information whether I
should change something.
