## Building from source

A Rust installation is required. This project was done using v1.87.0. Clone this
repository and use `cargo` to build/test/run the application. Additional
dependencies are `CMake` and `clang` for the raylib crate. On Linux use your
favourite package manager. On Windows follow the instructions on the websites of
the tools (when installing choose to add them to your PATH).

Refer to the testing documentation on how to produce code coverage.

## Executable

As an alternative there are executables published as a release on the GitHub
repository. (As of now, they are outdated.)
